# Brain-Tumor

This repo corresponds to the Kaggle Competition: RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification
https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification

The notebook uses https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification as a reference and compiles additional ideas from me/from other notebooks form the competition.

<h2>Pretrained Model</h2>
(more models to be added once PyTorch to TensorFlow conversion has been completed)

WIP: As most pretrained models uses PyTorch, this notebook aims to do a conversion from PyTorch pretrained models and use it on TensorFlow.
